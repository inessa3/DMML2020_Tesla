### _Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets_
In this project we are going to build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. Firstly, we will clean data (the training data), then we will try to build the best possible binary classification model to predict whether a given tweet from another dataset (the test data) is talking about the real disaster or a fake one. We will aim to get the highest accuracy possible. Finally, we will continuously submit our results on AIcrowd to compete with other teams.
>**NLP**: is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

📍Week 9-15 November:
1.   We got acquainted with each other 
2.   We created slack channel, github repository for further collaboration (all the members are there 👍)
3.   We also created a team on AIcrowd and joined the competition 🏆 

📍Week 16-22 November:
1.   We have started working on the project in Colab 🗃
        *   Download and describe the training dataset (shape, base rate)
        *   Clean the dataset (duplicates etc WRITE MORE LATER)
        *   Build a model with SpaCy
        *   Make our first prediction 🔮
2.   Uploaded our csv file on AIcrowd
        *   Our accuracy was 0.803 and the F1 score 0.803, too. 

📍 Week 23-29 November:
1.   We have continued working on the project in Colab
        *   We tuned the parameters of the classifier and vectorizer
        *   We also proceeded with EDA 📉
2.   Uploaded several csv files on AIcrowd and, finally, upgraded our score
        *   Our accuracy and the F1 was 0.811 🎉
3.   Made a weekly update on Github (+downloaded our first code) and prepared PowerPoint

📍 Week 30-6 December:
1.   We have continued working on the project in Colab
        *   We made additional data cleaning and try to do more predictions.
        *   We tried grid-search to find better parameters (it does not help us to upgrade our score).
        *   We have also worked on ther classifiers, mainly knn and decision trees.
2.   Uploaded several csv files on AIcrowd but our score was not higher than the previous ones 😢
3.   Made a weekly update on Github

📍 Week 7-13 December:
1.   We have continued working on the project in Colab
        *   We tried to clean test data and repeat the predictions we had with the cleaned version but nothing has improved (we submitted that to AIcrowd but did not present it in notebooks).
        *   Later, we have started preparing our final version of notebooks. We took decisions on the structure of the notebooks (we also add the graph of our progress).
2.   We prepared the Power Point presentation for Monday and  started preparing our video.
3.   Made a weekly update on Github

📍 Week 14-20 December:
1.   We finalize all the notebooks we have for this project.
2.   We recorded a video to be posted on Youtube and shared with our classmates.
3.   Made a weekly update on Github.
3.   Made a post with a link to video on Slack.

Enjoy!
