### _Real or Not? NLP with Disaster Tweets_
In this project we are going to build a Machine Learning model that can predict which tweets are about a real disaster and which are not. Firstly, we will clean data (the training data), then we will try to build the best possible binary classification model to predict whether a given tweet from another dataset (the test data) is talking about the real disaster or a fake one. We will aim to get the highest accuracy possible. Finally, we will continously submit our results on AIcrowd to compete with other teams.
>**NLP**: is a subfield of linguistics, computer science, and artificial intelligence concerned with the interactions between computers and human language, in particular how to program computers to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data.

Week 9-15 November:
1.   We got acquainted with each other 👧👦👧
2.   We created slack channel, github repository for further collaboration (all the members are there 👍)
3.   We also created a team on AIcrowd and joined the competition 🏆 

Week 16-22 November:
1.   We have started working on the project in Colab
        *   Download and describe the training dataset (shape, base rate)
        *   Clean the dataset (NaN values?, duplicates etc WRITE MORE LATER)
        *   Build a a model with SpaCy
        *   Make our first prediction
2.  Uploaded our csv file on AIcrowd
